# S6-Angular: Introducci√≥n a Angular

![Conte](src/assets/s6.png "Conte")

A small app to explain a short story. The background image should change depending on the selected text.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.0.4.

I've also used **Bootstrap**
## Development server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
